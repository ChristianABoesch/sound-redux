# MusicDrop

**NOTE** We're here to make music that rocks.

In an effort to learn es6 and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), this is SoundRedux, a simple [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) client

See it in action at https://soundredux.io

Uses [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080`

Feedback, issues, etc. are more than welcome!
